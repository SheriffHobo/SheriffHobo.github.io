				<div class="abouttext">
					<p class="textbody">Damon was born in San Francisco in the early 1970's. After living in a haunted, or so his mother says, 
						apartment complex outside of Golden Gate park, his family moved to the Bay Area East Bay, known by some as "The Beast". 
						Growing up in the Bay Area offered Damon the chance to meet, live with, and friend humans from all walks off. This unique blend of 
						life and culture has helped shape him into the person he is today. A great advantage to living in the Bay Area is having a plethora of worlds 
						colliding all around. Because of this, Damon was introduced to motorcycles, food from all across the world, games, comic books, art, 
						and cultures that many people would never see unless they traveled outside of the USA. All of these added their stamp to Damon is 
						various ways. For example, his love of Moraccan food can be traced back to a time when his mother engaged in and taught Belly Dancing. 
						In the early 80s', as Anime was new to the USA, Damon and his friends would have to venture to San Francisco to rent video tapes sent 
						over from Japan if they wanted to watch the lastest shows. This lead to a greater understanding as to how another culture sees cartoons. 
						As a side effect, this created a desire in Damon to better understand the Japanese culture, something he is still learning about today.
					</p>
					<p class="textbody">
						Today Damon is part of a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. After graduation, he hopes to gain employment as a Junior Developer.
