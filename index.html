            <p id="p1"><em>It's all in the reflexes</em> ~ <strong>Jack Burton</strong></p>
            <p>Damon was born in San Francisco in the early 1970's. After living in a haunted, or so his mother says, apartment complex outside of Golden Gate park, his family moved to the Bay Area East Bay, known by some as "The Beast".
                Growing up in the Bay Area offered Damon the chance to meet, live with, and friend humans from all walks off. This unique blend of life and culture has helped shape him into the person he is today.
                A great advantage to living in the Bay Area is having a plethora of worlds colliding all around. Because of this, Damon was introduced to motorcycles, food from all across the world, games, 
                comic books, art, and cultures that many people would never see unless they traveled outside of the USA. All of these added their stamp to Damon is various ways. For example, his love of Moraccan food can 
                be traced back to a time when his mother engaged in and taught Belly Dancing. In the early 80s', as Anime was new to the USA, Damon and his friends would have to venture to San Francisco to rent video 
                tapes sent over from Japan if they wanted to watch the lastest shows. This lead to a greater understanding as to how another culture sees cartoons. As a side effect, this created a desire in Damon to 
                better understand the Japanese culture, something he is still learning about today. 
            </p>
            <p>When it comes to education, Damon lives by the mottos, "Question Everything", and "Failure is always an option". Discover, testing, practice, and learning from mistakes aided Damon in becoming a mini 
                Jack of All Trades. As a motorcycle enthusiast, instead of just paying someone to change is brakes, he sat down and learned to do it himself. In his gaming life, he's learned a fair amount of Photoshop and 
                Illustrator all in the name of doing the design work himself, and sometimes with the help of his friends. 
            </p>
            <p>It's all in the reflexes, as our hero Jack Burton put it, is more than just a quote from Damons all time favorite movie, but it's also a dash of philosophy. Reflexes do not need to just mean how quick you are 
                with your hands, feeet, eyes, but it can also about how one approaches opportunities life presents to us. We can look at any opportunity as a thing to be afraid of, like making a total career change into web 
                development at 47, or we can simply keep going down the same road, never looking for a side path. However, Damon would say, it's those side paths that hold the real adventure, the true life. Your instinct, or 
                reflex, might tell you to stay the course, but then again, maybe that dark path to the left hides a new adventure. The only way to find out is heading into the unknown. It's all in the reflexes.
